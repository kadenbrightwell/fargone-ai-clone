# Far Gone

### Story

A second ship leaving Earth, bound for a new home, encounters trouble in space. A child, awoken suddenly by a malfunction in his cryo pod, attempts to wake the others but finds them all dead, having suffocated in their pods from a malfunction he just barely avoided. 

As his escape pod approaches its destination, it encounters more burn in the atmosphere of the encroaching planet than expected. Losing one of its engines, it crashes into the planet.

The child, now lost on this mysterious planet, must figure out how to restore a love of music to a world in which it has been made illegal.
